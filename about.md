In the near future, the United Space Federation launches a
self-sustaining colony that orbits the Moon to try to find a way for
humanity to survive. Bri, a young engineer, leaves behind her life on
Earth to work on the Lunar Space Colony to try to help those
that remain back home.

_Lunar Space Colony_ is a weekly, vertical webcomic. New episodes are
published every Tuesday morning. The intended length of the series is
around 24 episodes.
